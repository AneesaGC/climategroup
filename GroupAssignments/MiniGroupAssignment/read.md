## Heat Vulnerability in Los Angeles, California
#### Link to proposal: https://github.com/AneesaGC/climategroup/blob/main/README.md 

## Roles: 
### Pa-Shun Hawkins (Census Data Mapper): This week she will map the distribution of vulnerable communities across LA. These communities have been cited as groups that are highly impacted by heat (i.e., individuals 65+ and minorities). She will also map the distribution of tree canopy cover.  

### Aneesa:(NIHHIS Data Mapper): This week I will map the heat waves number of events, social vulnerability score, and the building value in LA. I will make various choropleth maps and a folium map.

## Status update: 
### Currently, we are making progress in formulating a clear research objective. Specifically, we are in the process of refining the variables that we intend to examine in relation to heat to understand its impact. Additionally, we have conducted meetings to categorize various vulnerability factors that we aim to map, drawing insights from relevant literature. 
## Data update:

### Data used by Pa-Shun: [Heat Health Census tracts](https://gis-for-racialequity.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/7f05981247034b5da1887f14b7ed523b/explore) and [City of LA boundary](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=77f61d02dedf4e858ab8af36e7cdd35a) 
### The heat and health census  has data on demographic and environmental information  in support of climate resilience planning for urban heat health. It will be used to map  individuals 65+, minorities, and the distribution of tree canopy cover in LA. The City boundary layer is the legal boundary of the City of Los Angeles. 

### Data used by Aneesa: [NIHHIS](https://www.heat.gov/datasets/9da4eeb936544335a6db0cd7a8448a51_0/about)
### This is the data set I am using from the NIHHIS. This link gives information on heatwave data regarding several different categories. I will be focusing on heat waves, the number of events, the social vulnerability score, and the building value in LA county.
 
### Data used by Yu: 

## Concerns:  
### No major concerns at this time. Troubleshooting folium map plans to improve the map (Aneesa).

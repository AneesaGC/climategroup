## **Research Question:**
Are  socioeconomic classes disproportionately affected by excessively warm weather conditions in Los Angeles, California?
 
**Introduction** 

Heatwaves considerably influence society, with a notable uptick in heat-related fatalities. However, they often get overlooked because their effects are not immediately apparent. Additionally, the escalating impact of climate change amplifies the frequency and severity of heat waves. 
This escalating trend poses a significant threat to socially vulnerable groups, such as low-income households, communities of color, individuals experiencing homelessness, and immigrant populations. Many of these groups reside in urban areas, which are areas susceptible to extreme heat due to urban heat islands. Moreover, vulnerable communities face compounded risks due to insufficient housing insulation and the inability to afford air conditioning.

Unfortunately, Los Angeles (LA), California, the second most populous city in the United States, is not exempt from the ramifications of these weather extremes. Climate-change projections for California indicate a continuous rise in greenhouse gas emissions, with the state expected to warm by over 2 degrees Fahrenheit by 2040 and more than 6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. Consequently, our research hopes to shed light on the potential disproportionate impact of heat exposure on the residents of California, highlighting the urgency for targeted interventions and strategies to mitigate the risks faced by vulnerable populations.

**Importance of Question**

This project provides the opportunity to understand how hot weather affects different socioeconomic classes and helps uncover potential disparities in exposure and vulnerability. Los Angeles experiences the urban heat island effect, where urban areas are significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Investigating how this phenomenon affects different socioeconomic classes provides insights into potential disparities in exposure and vulnerability.
Our research can inform urban planning strategies and policy design to policymakers. Identifying areas where vulnerable socioeconomic groups are disproportionately affected by high temperatures can guide the development of targeted interventions and climate-resilient infrastructure.



**Spatial Scope**

The spatial scope of our project covers the city of Los Angeles, California. A spatial aspect is crucial because different areas within Los Angeles County may experience varying degrees of exposure to heat, and socioeconomic factors can contribute to disparities in vulnerability.
Spatial research on high heat can inform urban planning strategies. Identifying hotspots helps city planners develop strategies to mitigate the urban heat island effect, such as incorporating green spaces, cool roofs, and other heat-reducing infrastructure, which is especially important for the poverty population to minimize the diseases caused by high heat. Understanding the spatial distribution of high heat can aid in optimizing energy use, particularly during peak heat periods, and contribute to more energy-using efficiency, which decreases carbon emissions.



**Preliminary Data Sources**

The data sources that the group is using is from the Heat.Gov National Integrated Heat Health Information System (NIHHIS) and the US Census Bureau. The main categories we will be assessing in NIHHIS are social vulnerability and community resilience, population, and heat waves in Los Angeles, CA. The US Census Bureau data we will be pulling is racial demographics in Los Angeles, CA. We will be using these data sets to compare areas of racial inequity and vulnerability with the number of heat waves in the given area.

**Scope of Intended Analysis**

Our intended analysis aims to create a comprehensive map and integrate layers of heat and social vulnerabilities (i.e., race and income). By combining these layers, we seek to examine the correlation between heat indexes and socioeconomic classes in the Los Angeles area. Our goal is to visualize the distribution of these factors collectively, providing a clearer understanding of how different groups of people distribute around these environmental and social variables.



**Conclusion**

Our anticipated results include identifying a correlation between disadvantaged communities and locations experiencing elevated heat waves in Los Angeles. Emphasizing this correlation is crucial, and the goal is to create a visual representation via mapping. This importance stems from the fact that despite often contributing the least to environmental degradation, disadvantaged communities are disproportionately vulnerable to them. The visual representation aims to raise awareness about the unequal impact on communities in Los Angeles, prompting the need for decisive action.
Furthermore, our research findings can contribute valuable information to urban planning policies. Our hope is that policymakers will develop adaptive strategies to protect vulnerable populations and improve overall urban sustainability.
